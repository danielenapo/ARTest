## How to use
The app will show the 3D model of the moon and some informations when looking at this image:

(note: the image should be on the ground)

When pressing the button "Add image from gallery", chose a new reference image from the gallery. It will show the same model of the moon when looked at.

You can add up to 1000 images in total, but only a maximum of 20 images will simultaneously display the model.

## Advices about loading images from gallery
To add reference images from gallery, the image should be squared and approximately 10x10 cm wide.
It works with other sizes and with rectangular images too, but the tracking may not be very accurate.

If you load a photo that you have taken, be sure to be in neutral light conditions, and crop the photo to only have the interested image area before uploading it to the app, or else it would probably not recognise it.
